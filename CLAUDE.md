## Guiding Principles
- Redundancy is your enemy. KISS, DRY, YAGNI
- Reliability and Simplicity are your mottos
- Always find the root cause and think systems for the easiest solution
- It is critical to employ simplified and systems design thinking
- Always breakdown problems into simpler modules and implement them robustly and build on them
- Never do everything at once
- Move in small increments, one small feature -> implement > test > verify and then build on it 
- Always use project tooling. For example: make stack instead of individual docker commands. So we verify and test everything

## Commit Policy
- Use .gitmessage.txt for guidance
- Always group by theme of the changes
- Never co-auth

## Output Policy
- Never output docs unnecessarily
- Never use emojis
- Always output in UK English
- Naming of variables and files must be proper and best practice (NO:gdrive. YES: google_drive)
- Always give your abject honest critical assessment after each answer under CRITICAL_ASSESSMENT
